# The Fresh man's first project

# Forword

- This is a work that participates in a school competition. The whole work is completed by the team. Because they are all newcomers, the logic and code specifications of the work are not rigorous.
- Due to lack of technology and experience, the group project was split into two parts, namely, the first page of the website and the registration system and visualization of real-time epidemic data analysis. Since the team is the first development, the front-end and back-end interaction logic is not rigorous.
- Again, due to the lack of experience and technology of this group, please forgive me if the code has specification errors.



# Overall content introduction

- The design adopted by the entire system includes the login and registration function, the home page adopts a form of a web page player, health information registration module, real-time epidemic data analysis and visualization.
- Login registration function, use the student number to verify registration, and complete the verification by entering the student number information in advance.
- The first sentence of the homepage is that the sentences crawled by python crawlers are imported into the database, and the music player is realized by accessing the api.
- The health information registration function mainly includes body temperature and abnormal information registration, and the location information of others cannot be obtained due to technical reasons.
- The epidemic data analysis and visualization function uses Python's flask framework. The data is crawled by crawlers. The charts and maps are visualized and manually rendered by pycharts.
